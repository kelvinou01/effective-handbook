We hope that these tools can help you as you think through how you can best help the world.\nWe also want to share some of the arguments for working on specific problems, like global health or biosecurity. People involved in effective altruism tend to agree that, partly due to uncertainty about which cause is best, we should split our resources between problems. But they don’t agree on what that split should be. People in the effective altruism community actively discuss and disagree about which causes to prioritize and how, even though we’ve learned a lot over the last decade. We hope that you will take these ideas seriously and think for yourself about which ways to help are most effective.\nFinally, we give you some time at the end of the program to begin to reflect on how you personally can help to solve these problems. We don’t expect you’ll have an answer by the end of the eight weeks, but we hope you’re better prepared to explore this further.\nWhat the program involves # Each part of the program has a set of core posts and sometimes an exercise.\nWe think that the core posts take most people about 1-2 hours to get through, and the exercise another 30-60 minutes. We have matched the readings and exercises so that, in total, we think it will take around 2-2.5 hours per week to prepare for the weekly session.\nThe exercises help you put the concepts from the reading into practice.\nBeyond the core posts, there are more materials each week in ‘More to Explore’ — these are all optional and explore the themes of the week in more depth and breadth.\nApproximate reading times are given for each of the posts. Generally, we’d prefer you to take your time and think through the readings instead of rushing.\nThis curriculum was drawn up by staff from the Centre for Effective Altruism, incorporating feedback from others. Ultimately we had to make many judgement calls, and other people would have drawn up a different curriculum. 2\nHow we hope you’ll approach the program # Taking ideas seriously # Often, conversations about ideas are recreational: we enjoy batting around interesting thoughts and saying smart things, and then go back to doing whatever we were already doing in our lives. This is a fine thing to do — but at least sometimes, we think we should be asking ourselves questions like:\n“How could I tell if this idea was true?” “What evidence would it take to convince me that I was wrong about an idea?” “If it is true, what does that imply I should be doing differently in my life? What else does it imply I’m wrong about?” “How might this impact my plans for my career/life?” And, zooming out:\n“Where are my blind spots?” “Which important questions should I be thinking about that I’m not?” “Do I really know if this idea/plan will help make things better or not?” Answering these questions can help make our worldviews as accurate and full as possible and, by extension, help us make better decisions about things that we care about.\nDisagreements are useful # When thoughtful people with access to the same information reach very different conclusions from each other, we should be curious about why and we should actively encourage people to voice and investigate where those disagreements are coming from. If, for example, a medical community is divided on whether Treatment A or B does a better job of curing some disease, they should want to get to the bottom of that disagreement, because the right answer matters — lives are at stake. If you start off disagreeing with someone then change your mind, that can be hard to admit, but we think that should be celebrated. Helping conversations become clearer by changing your mind in response to arguments you find compelling will help the community act to save lives more effectively Even if you don’t expect to end up agreeing with the other person, you’ll learn more if you acknowledge that you disagree and try to understand exactly how and why their views disagree with yours.\nBe aware of our privilege and the seriousness of these issues # We shouldn’t lose sight of our privilege in being able to read and discuss these ideas, or that we are talking about real lives. We’re lucky to be in a position where we can have such a large impact, and this opportunity for impact is the consequence of a profoundly unequal world. Also, be conscious of the fact that people in this program come to these discussions with different ideas, backgrounds, and knowledge. Some of these topics can be uncomfortable to talk about — which is one of the reasons they’re so neglected, and so important to talk about — especially when we may have personal ties to some of these areas.\nExplore further # This handbook aims to introduce people to effective altruism in a structured manner.

I fervently hope that one day we will be able to save everyone. In the meantime, it is irresponsible to pretend that we aren’t making life and death decisions with the allocation of our resources. Pretending there is no choice only makes our decisions worse.\u0026quot;\n— Holly Elmore, explaining the need to prioritize given our limited resources.\nIn this chapter we’ll explore why you might want to help others, why it’s so critical to think carefully about how many people are affected by an intervention, and come to terms with the tradeoffs we face in our altruistic efforts.\nKey concepts in this chapter include:\nScope sensitivity: saving ten lives is more important than saving one, and saving a billion lives is a lot more important than saving ten. Tradeoffs: Because we have limited time and money, we need to prioritize between different ways to improve the world. Scout mindset: We’ll be better able to help others if we’re working together to think clearly and orient towards finding the truth, rather than trying to defend our own ideas. Humans naturally aren’t great at this (aside from wanting to defend our own ideas, we have a host of other biases), but if we want to really understand the world, it’s worth seeking the truth and trying to become clearer thinkers.
