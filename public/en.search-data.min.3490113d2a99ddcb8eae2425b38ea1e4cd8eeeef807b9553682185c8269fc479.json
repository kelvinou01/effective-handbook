We hope that these tools can help you as you think through how you can best help the world.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/chapters/the-effectiveness-mindset/the-effectiveness-mindset/","title":"The Effectiveness Mindset","section":"The Effectiveness Mindset","content":"In this chapter we’ll explore why you might want to help others, why it’s so critical to think carefully about how many people are affected by an intervention, and come to terms with the tradeoffs we face in our altruistic efforts.\nKey concepts in this chapter include:\nScope sensitivity: saving ten lives is more important than saving one, and saving a billion lives is a lot more important than saving ten. Tradeoffs: Because we have limited time and money, we need to prioritize between different ways to improve the world. Scout mindset: We’ll be better able to help others if we’re working together to think clearly and orient towards finding the truth, rather than trying to defend our own ideas. Humans naturally aren’t great at this (aside from wanting to defend our own ideas, we have a host of other biases), but if we want to really understand the world, it’s worth seeking the truth and trying to become clearer thinkers.

Efforts to help them - by policy reform, cash transfers, or provision of health services - can be incredibly effective.\nAlongside investigating this issue, we also discuss how much more effective some interventions are than others, and we introduce a simple tool for estimating important figures.\nKey concepts from this session include:\nDifferences in impact: It appears that some of our options to help do many times more good than others. People generally don’t appreciate this, and so miss out on significant opportunities to help. The importance, neglectedness, tractability framework: The most important problems generally affect a lot of people (importance or scale), are relatively under-invested in (neglectedness), and can be meaningfully improved with a reasonable amount of work (tractability). Thinking on the margin: If you\u0026rsquo;re donating $1, you should give that extra $1 to the intervention that can most cost-effectively improve the world. There are many great initiatives with a very high average impact per dollar that will have a low marginal impact because they can\u0026rsquo;t get the same efficiency at scale (they display \u0026ldquo;diminishing marginal returns\u0026rdquo;). Fermi estimates: When you’re trying to make a decision, it can be useful to make a rough calculation for which option is best. Even if there’s a lot of uncertainty, this can give you a rough answer, and can tell you which things are most important to estimate next. "}]
