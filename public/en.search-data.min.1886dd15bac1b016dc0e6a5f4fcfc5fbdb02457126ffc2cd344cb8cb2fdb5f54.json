Tradeoffs: Because we have limited time and money, we need to prioritize between different ways to improve the world. Scout mindset: We’ll be better able to help others if we’re working together to think clearly and orient towards finding the truth, rather than trying to defend our own ideas. Humans naturally aren’t great at this (aside from wanting to defend our own ideas, we have a host of other biases), but if we want to really understand the world, it’s worth seeking the truth and trying to become clearer thinkers. That\u0026rsquo;s the flashcard\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/posts/the-effectiveness-mindset/about-this-handbook/","title":"About This Handbook","section":"Posts","content":"Effective altruism (EA) is an ongoing project to find the best ways to do good, and put them into practice.\nOur core goal with this program is to introduce you to some of the principles and thinking tools behind effective altruism.
