<p><strong>Effective altruism (EA) is an ongoing project to find the best ways to do good, and put them into practice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our core goal with this program is to introduce you to some of the principles and thinking tools behind effective altruism</strong>. We hope that these tools can help you as you think through how you can best help the world.</p>
<p>We also want to share some of the arguments for working on specific problems, like global health or biosecurity. People involved in effective altruism tend to agree that, partly due to uncertainty about which cause is best, we should split our resources between problems. But they don’t agree on what that split should be. <strong>People in the effective altruism community actively discuss and disagree about which causes to prioritize and how</strong>, even though we’ve learned a lot over the last decade. We hope that you will take these ideas seriously and think for yourself about which ways to help are most effective.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, we give you some time at the end of the program to begin to reflect on how you personally can help to solve these problems.</strong> We don’t expect you’ll have an answer by the end of the eight weeks, but we hope you’re better prepared to explore this further.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-program-involves">
  What the program involves
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-the-program-involves">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Each part of the program has a set of core posts and sometimes an exercise.</p>
<p>We think that the core posts take most people about 1-2 hours to get through, and the exercise another 30-60 minutes. We have matched the readings and exercises so that, in total, we think it will take around 2-2.5 hours per week to prepare for the weekly session.</p>
<p>The exercises help you put the concepts from the reading into practice.</p>
<p>Beyond the core posts, there are more materials each week in ‘More to Explore’ — these are all optional and explore the themes of the week in more depth and breadth.</p>
<p>Approximate reading times are given for each of the posts. Generally, we’d prefer you to take your time and think through the readings instead of rushing.</p>
<p>This curriculum was drawn up by staff from the Centre for Effective Altruism, incorporating feedback from others. Ultimately we had to make many judgement calls, and other people would have drawn up a different curriculum. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

  Taking ideas seriously

</h3>
<p>Often, conversations about ideas are recreational: we enjoy batting around interesting thoughts and saying smart things, and then go back to doing whatever we were already doing in our lives. This is a fine thing to do — but at least sometimes, we think we should be asking ourselves questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>“How could I tell if this idea was true?”</li>
<li>“What evidence would it take to convince me that I was wrong about an idea?”</li>
<li>“If it is true, what does that imply I should be doing differently in my life? What else does it imply I’m wrong about?”</li>
<li>“How might this impact my plans for my career/life?”</li>
</ul>
<p>And, zooming out:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Where are my blind spots?”</li>
<li>“Which important questions should I be thinking about that I’m not?”</li>
<li>“Do I really know if this idea/plan will help make things better or not?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Answering these questions can help make our worldviews as accurate and full as possible and, by extension, help us make better decisions about things that we care about.</p>
<h3 id="disagreements-are-useful">
  Disagreements are useful
  <a class="anchor" href="#disagreements-are-useful">#</a>
</h3>
<p>When thoughtful people with access to the same information reach very different conclusions from each other, we should be curious about why and we should actively encourage people to voice and investigate where those disagreements are coming from. If, for example, a medical community is divided on whether Treatment A or B does a better job of curing some disease, they should want to get to the bottom of that disagreement, because the right answer matters — lives are at stake. If you start off disagreeing with someone then change your mind, that can be hard to admit, but we think that should be celebrated. Helping conversations become clearer by changing your mind in response to arguments you find compelling will help the community act to save lives more effectively Even if you don’t expect to end up agreeing with the other person, you’ll learn more if you acknowledge that you disagree and try to understand exactly how and why their views disagree with yours.</p>

</h3>
<p>We shouldn’t lose sight of our privilege in being able to read and discuss these ideas, or that we are talking about real lives. We’re lucky to be in a position where we can have such a large impact, and this opportunity for impact is the consequence of a profoundly unequal world. Also, be conscious of the fact that people in this program come to these discussions with different ideas, backgrounds, and knowledge. Some of these topics can be uncomfortable to talk about — which is one of the reasons they’re so neglected, and so important to talk about — especially when we may have personal ties to some of these areas.</p>

<p>This handbook aims to introduce people to effective altruism in a structured manner. There are far too many relevant topics, ideas, and research for all but a small fraction of them to fit into this very short program.

<p>“We are always in triage. I fervently hope that one day we will be able to save everyone. In the meantime, it is irresponsible to pretend that we aren’t making life and death decisions with the allocation of our resources. Pretending there is no choice only makes our decisions worse.&quot;</p>
<p>— 
  <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/B79ro5zkhndbBKRRX/p/vQpk3cxdAe5RX9xzo">Holly Elmore</a>, explaining the need to prioritize given our limited resources.</p>
<p>In this chapter we’ll explore why you might want to help others, why it’s so critical to think carefully about how many people are affected by an intervention, and come to terms with the tradeoffs we face in our altruistic efforts.</p>
<p>Key concepts in this chapter include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scope sensitivity</strong>: saving ten lives is more important than saving one, and saving a billion lives is a lot more important than saving ten.</li>
<li><strong>Tradeoffs</strong>: Because we have limited time and money, we need to prioritize between different ways to improve the world.</li>
<li><strong>Scout mindset</strong>: We’ll be better able to help others if we’re working together to think clearly and orient towards finding the truth, rather than trying to defend our own ideas. Humans naturally aren’t great at this (aside from wanting to defend our own ideas, we have a host of other biases), but if we want to really understand the world, it’s worth seeking the truth and trying to become clearer thinkers.</li>

  What is effective altruism?
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-is-effective-altruism">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Effective altruism is a project that aims to find the best ways to help others, and put them into practice.</p>
<p>It’s both a <strong>research field</strong>, which aims to identify the world’s most pressing problems and the best solutions to them, and a *practical community** that aims to use those findings to do good.</p>
<p>This project matters because, while many attempts to do good fail, some are enormously effective. For instance, some charities help 100 or even 1,000 times as many people as others, when given the same amount of resources.</p>
<p>This means that by thinking carefully about the best ways to help, we can do far more to tackle the world’s biggest problems.</p>
<p>Effective altruism was formalized by scholars at Oxford University, but has now spread around the world, and is being applied by tens of thousands of people in more than 70 countries.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>People inspired by effective altruism have worked on projects that range from funding the distribution of 200 million malaria nets, to academic research on the future of AI, to campaigning for policies to prevent the next pandemic.</p>
<p>They’re not united by any particular solution to the world’s problems, but by a way of thinking. They try to find unusually good ways of helping, such that a given amount of effort goes an unusually long way. Here are some examples of what they&rsquo;ve done so far, followed by the values that unite them:</p>

<p>People in effective altruism 
  <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/itn-framework">typically try to</a> identify issues that are big in scale, tractable, and unfairly neglected.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> The aim is to find the biggest gaps in current efforts, in order to find where an additional person can have the greatest impact. One issue that seems to match those criteria is preventing pandemics.</p>
<p>Researchers in effective altruism argued as early as 2014 that, given the history of near-misses, there was a good chance that a large pandemic would happen in our lifetimes.</p>
<p>But preparing for the next pandemic was, and remains, hugely underfunded compared to other global issues. For instance, the US invests around $8bn per year preventing pandemics, compared to around $280bn per year spent on counterterrorism over the last decade.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/preventing-pandemics.png" alt="Pandemic prevention spreading" /></p>
<p>Preventing terror attacks is certainly important. But the scale of the issue seems smaller. For instance, just to focus on the number of deaths, in the last 50 years, around 500,000 people have been killed by terrorism. But over 21 million people were killed by COVID-19 alone<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> – or consider the 40 million killed by HIV/AIDS.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/people-died-pandemics.png" alt="Pandemic deaths comparison" /></p>
<p>Not to mention, a future pandemic could easily be much worse than COVID-19: there’s nothing to rule out a disease that’s more infectious than the Omicron variant, but that’s as deadly as smallpox. (See more on the comparison in footnote <sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.)</p>
<p>In effective altruism, once a big and neglected problem has been identified, the community then looks for solutions that have a chance of making a big contribution to solving the problem, and are neglected by others working on that issue, which brings us to&hellip;</p>
<h4 id="some-examples-of-whats-been-done">
  Some examples of what’s been done
  <a class="anchor" href="#some-examples-of-whats-been-done">#</a>
</h4>
<p>In 2016 Open Philanthropy – a foundation inspired by effective altruism – became the largest funder of the 
  <a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/">Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security</a>, which is one of the few groups doing research to identify better policy responses to pandemics, and was an important group in the response to COVID-19.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>When COVID-19 broke out, members of the community founded 
  <a href="https://www.1daysooner.org/">1DaySooner</a>, a non-profit that advocates for human challenge trials. In this type of vaccine trial, healthy volunteers are deliberately infected with the disease, enabling near-instant testing of the vaccine. As one of the only advocates for this intervention, 1DaySooner has signed up over 30,000 volunteers,<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> and played an important role in starting the world’s first COVID-19 human challenge trial. This model can be repeated when we face the next pandemic.</p>
<p>Members of the effective altruism community helped to create the 
  <a href="https://biodefensecommission.org/reports/the-apollo-program-for-biodefense-winning-the-race-against-biological-threats/">Apollo Programme for Biodefense</a>, a multibillion dollar policy proposal designed to prevent the next pandemic.</p>

<p>It’s common to say that charity begins at home, but in effective altruism, charity begins where we can help the most. And this often means focusing on the people who are most neglected by the current system – which is often those who are more distant from us.</p>
<p>Over 700 million people live on less than $1.90 per day.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>
<p>In contrast, an American living near the poverty line lives on 20 times as much, and the average American college graduate lives on about 107 times as much. This places them in the top 1.3% of income, globally speaking.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> (These amounts are already adjusted for the fact that money goes further in poor countries.)</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/income-inequality.png" alt="Income distribution" /></p>
<p>Global inequality is extreme. Because of this, transferring resources to the very poorest people in the world can do a huge amount of good. In richer countries like the US and UK, governments are typically willing to spend over $1 million to save a life.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> This is well worth doing, but in the world’s poorest countries, the cost of saving a life is far lower.</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a> is an organization that does in-depth research to find the most evidence-backed and cost-effective health and development projects. It discovered that while 
  <a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/criteria/impact/failure-stories">many aid interventions don’t work</a>, some, like providing insecticide-treated bednets, can save a child’s life for about $5,500 on average. That&rsquo;s 180 times less.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p>
<p>These basic medical interventions are so cheap and effective that even the

  Why this issue?

</h4>
<p>People in effective altruism often end up focusing on issues that seem counterintuitive, obscure or exaggerated. But this is because it’s more impactful to work on the issues that are neglected by others (all else equal), and these issues are (almost by definition) going to be unconventional ones. One example is the AI alignment problem.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is progressing rapidly. The leading AI systems are now able to engage in limited conversation, solve college-level maths problems, explain jokes, generate extremely realistic images from text, and do basic coding.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> None of this was possible just ten years ago.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of the leading AI labs is to develop AI that is as good as, or better than, human beings on all tasks. It’s extremely hard to predict the future of technology, but 
  <a href="https://www.cold-takes.com/where-ai-forecasting-stands-today/">various arguments and expert surveys suggest</a> that this achievement is more likely than not this century. And according to 
  <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/could-advanced-ai-drive-explosive-economic-growth/">standard economic models</a>, once general AI can perform at human level, technological progress could dramatically accelerate.</p>
<p>The result would be an enormous transformation, perhaps of a significance similar to or greater than the industrial revolution in the 1800s. If handled well, this transformation could bring about abundance and prosperity for everyone. If handled poorly, it could result in an extreme concentration of power in the hands of a tiny elite.</p>
<p>In the worst case, we could 
  <a href="https://www.cold-takes.com/ai-could-defeat-all-of-us-combined/">lose control</a> of the AI systems themselves. Unable to govern beings with capabilities far greater than our own, we would find ourselves with as little control over our future as chimpanzees have control over theirs.</p>
<p>This means this issue could not only have a dramatic impact on the present generation, but also on all future generations. This makes it especially pressing from a 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longtermism">“longtermist”</a> perspective, a school of thinking which holds that improving the long-term future is a key moral priority of our time.</p>
<p>How to ensure AI systems continue to further human values, even as they become equal (or superior) to humans in their capabilities, is called the AI alignment problem, and solving it requires advances in computer science.</p>
<p>Despite its potentially historic importance, only a couple of hundred researchers work on this problem, compared to tens of thousands working to make AI systems more powerful.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>
<p>

<p>One priority is to simply tell more people about the issue. The book 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies">Superintelligence</a> was published in 2014, making the case for the importance of AI alignment, and became a 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies#Reception">New York Times best-seller</a>.</p>
<p>Another priority is to build a research field focused on this problem. For instance, AI pioneer Stuart Russell, and others inspired by effective altruism, founded 
  <a href="https://humancompatible.ai/">The Center for Human-Compatible AI</a> at UC Berkeley. This research institute aims to develop a new paradigm of AI development, in which the act of furthering human values is central.</p>
<p>Others have helped to start teams focused on AI alignment at major AI labs such as 
  <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/safety-and-ethics">DeepMind</a> and 
  <a href="https://openai.com/safety">OpenAI</a>, and outline research agendas for AI alignment, in works such as

<p>People in effective altruism try to extend their circle of concern – not only to those living in distant countries or future generations, but also to non-human animals.</p>
<p>Nearly 10 billion animals live and die in factory farms in the US every year<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> – often unable to physically turn around their entire lives, or castrated without anaesthetic.</p>
<p>Lots of people agree we shouldn’t make animals suffer needlessly, but most of this attention goes towards pet shelters.

<p>One strategy is advocacy. The 
  <a href="https://openwingalliance.org/impact">Open Wing Alliance</a>, which received significant funding from funders inspired by effective altruism, developed a campaign to encourage large companies to commit to stop buying eggs from caged chickens. To date, they have won over 2,200 commitments, and as a result over 100 million birds have been spared from cages.[^21]</p>
<p>Another strategy is to create alternative proteins, which if made cheaper and tastier than factory farmed meat, could make demand disappear, ending factory farming. The 
  <a href="https://gfi.org/">Good Food Institute</a> is working to kick-start this industry, helping to create companies like Dao Foods in China and Good Catch in the US, encouraging big business to enter the industry (including JBS, the world’s largest meat company) and securing tens of millions of dollars of government support.[^22]</p>

<p>People who want to do good often prefer to directly tackle problems, since it’s more motivating to see the tangible effects of their actions. But what matters is that the world gets better, not that you do it with your own two hands. So people applying effective altruism often try to help indirectly, by empowering others.</p>
<p>One example of this is by improving decision-making. Namely: if key actors — such as politicians, private and third sector leaders, or grantmakers at funding bodies — were generally better at making decisions, society would be in a better position to deal with a whole range of future global problems, whatever they turn out to be.</p>
<p>So, if we can find new, neglected ways to improve the decision-making of important actors, that could be a route to having a big impact. And it seems like there are some promising solutions that could achieve this.</p>

The potential consequences, both positive and negative, are compared to the significance of the industrial revolution. If handled well, AI advancements could bring prosperity, but if mismanaged, power could concentrate in the hands of a few, or worse, control could be lost.

  What values unite effective altruism?
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-values-unite-effective-altruism">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Effective altruism isn&rsquo;t defined by the projects above, and what it focuses on could easily change. What defines effective altruism are some tentative values and principles that underpin its search for the best ways of helping others:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Prioritization</strong>: Our 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_neglect">intuitions</a> about doing good don&rsquo;t usually take into account the scale of the outcomes — helping 100 people often makes us feel as satisfied as helping 1000. But since some ways of doing good also achieve dramatically more than others, it’s vital to attempt to use numbers to roughly weigh how much different actions help. The goal is to find the best ways to help, rather than just working to make any difference at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impartial altruism</strong>: It&rsquo;s easy — and reasonable — to have special concern for one&rsquo;s own family, friends or nation. But, when trying to do as much good as possible, it seems that we should give everyone&rsquo;s interests equal weight, no matter where or when they live. This means focusing on the groups who are most neglected, which usually means focusing on those who don’t have as much power to protect their own interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open truthseeking</strong>: Rather than starting with a commitment to a certain cause, community or approach, it’s important to consider many different ways to help and seek to find the best ones. This means putting serious time into deliberation and reflection on one’s beliefs, being constantly open and curious for new evidence and arguments, and being ready to change one’s views quite radically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaborative spirit</strong>: It’s often possible to achieve more by working together, and doing this effectively requires high standards of honesty, integrity, and compassion. Effective altruism does not mean supporting ‘ends justify the means’ reasoning, but rather is about being a good citizen, while working toward a better world.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We’re not totally confident in the above ideas - but we think that they are probably right, and that they are undervalued by much of society. Anyone who is trying to find better ways to help others is participating in effective altruism. This is true no matter how much time or money they want to give, or which issue they choose to focus on.</p>
<p>Effective altruism can be compared to the scientific method. Science is the use of evidence and reason in search of truth – even if the results are unintuitive or run counter to tradition. Effective altruism is the use of evidence and reason in search of the best ways of doing good.</p>
<p>The scientific method is based on simple ideas (e.g. that you should test your beliefs) but it leads to a radically different picture of the world (e.g. quantum mechanics). Likewise, effective altruism is based on simple ideas – that we should treat people equally and it’s better to help more people than fewer – but it leads to an unconventional and ever-evolving picture of doing good.</p>

<p>People interested in effective altruism most often attempt to apply the ideas in their lives by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Choosing careers that help tackle pressing problems, or by finding ways to use their existing skills to contribute to these problems, such as by using advice from 
  <a href="https://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Donating to carefully chosen charities, such as by using research from 
  <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a> or

</ul>
<p>See a

<p>The above are not exhaustive. You can apply effective altruism no matter how much you want to focus on doing good, and in any area of your life – what matters is that, no matter how much you want to contribute, your efforts are driven by the four values above, and you try to make your efforts as effective as possible.</p>
<p>Typically, this involves trying to identify big and neglected global problems, the most effective solutions to those problems, and ways you can contribute to those solutions – with whatever time or money you’re willing to give.</p>
<p>By doing this and thinking carefully, you might find it’s possible to have far more impact with those resources. It really is possible to save hundreds of people’s lives over your career. And by teaming up with others in the community, you can play a role in tackling some of the most important issues civilization faces today.</p>

<p>The less neglected an issue, the more the best opportunities will have been taken, so the harder it will be for an additional person to make an impact.</p>

<p>From 2010 to 2019, US Federal Funding for Health Security is estimated at $141 billion. We judge that 55% of this was spent on what could arguably prevent future pandemics. For example, 4% was spent tackling the ongoing ebola epidemic, which provided infrastructure for potential other pandemics. However, 17% was spent on chemical and nuclear radiation threats in a way unlikely to affect future pandemic spread.</p>

<p>Deaths from terrorism from 1970-2020 were approximately 456,000. This is from the Global Terrorism Database 2020, accessed 11 August 2022.</p>
<p>Note that Our World in Data says &ldquo;The Global Terrorism Database is the most comprehensive dataset on terrorist attacks available and recent data is complete. However, we expect, based on our analysis, that longer-term data is incomplete (with the exception of the US and Europe). We therefore do not recommend this dataset for the inference of long-term trends in the prevalence of terrorism globally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This means the source above is likely an undercount of confirmed terrorism deaths; however, even if we assume deaths have been at the same level as the highest recorded decade (2010-2020) since 1970, the total deathtoll would still only be 1.2 million; far less than deaths due to pandemics.</p>
<p>Deaths from COVID-19:</p>
<p>The Economist estimated cumulative excess deaths due to COVID-19 were 21.47m as of June 2022, and this amount is still rising.</p>
<p>You can see this data and their model through Our World in Data (archived page, retrieved 28 July 2022).</p>
<p>We see this as the best current estimate of COVID-19’s total death toll. The number of confirmed deaths is lower, at around 6 million, but this excludes deaths that were indirectly caused or weren’t reported. The Economist’s methodology compares excess deaths to the seasonal average, to estimate in total how many additional people died, and adjusts for underreporting.</p>
<p>Deaths due to pandemics and terrorism are both heavy tailed, so past death rates will typically understimate the magnitude of the risk.</p>
<p>For instance, it’s possible that terrorists could set off a nuclear weapon in a large city, which might kill over 1 million people. This didn’t happen over the last fifty years, but would have been the main driver of the death toll if it had. And likewise, there could have been a pandemic much worse than COVID-19 or HIV/AIDS in the last 50 years.</p>
<p>The key question then becomes whether the historical record is a greater undercount of the risk for terrorism or for pandemics (i.e. whether terrorism deaths are more heavily-tailed than pandemic deaths).</p>
<p>It seems plausible that the worst case scenario from pandemics is worse than for terrorism. There’s nothing to rule out the emergence of a pandemic that’s more infectious than COVID-19, but with a fatality rate of 10-50%, or worse. And there seem to be more near-misses in the historical record.</p>
<p>So, the problem of missing tail events in the sample may well be worse for pandemics than terrorism. Indeed, the most plausible way for terrorism to kill 1+ billion people is probably via causing a pandemic.</p>
<p>Given that terrorism receives ~100x more funding than pandemic prevention, while pandemics seem to have caused 10-100x more deaths historically, the corrections would need to be very heavily in favour of terrorism in order for the current allocation of resources to seem more balanced.</p>
<p>The above analysis was just in terms of the number of deaths, since that’s an important yet relatively measurable metric. Deaths due to both pandemics and terrorism also produce important indirect costs, and a fuller comparison would attempt to consider the relative scale of each.&#160;<a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a>&#160;<a href="#fnref1:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Before COVID-19, the number of people living on less that $1.90 per day had decreased to 689 million in 2017. However, estimates now point to the first rise in the extreme poverty rate since 1998, leading to an estimated 731 million people now living on less than $1.90 per day.</p>

The Federal Emergency Management Agency estimated the value of life at $7.5 million in 2020. This estimate has fluctuated based on the context.

<p>It’s difficult to estimate the number of researchers focused on a certain topic since it’s hard to define the topic in the first place, many researchers work on multiple topics, and it’s hard to know the bar for ‘being a researcher’. So these numbers should be understood as estimates to within a factor of three or so, and they could be out by an order of magnitude depending on some interpretations of the question.</p>
<p>In 2020, 87,000 authors published AI research on arXiv. The 2020 Global AI Talent Report from Element AI estimates there are even more people than this working on AI development globally, with 155,000 people labelled on social media as working in AI research or engineering. However we expect some working in AI engineering to not be working on engineering new advancements in AI. We have taken the smaller estimate of 87,000 and roughly halved it for an estimate of 40,000.</p>
<p>In 2021, Gavin Leech estimated that 270 to 830 FTE people worked on AI Safety. However, the upper end of the range of this estimate is based on what we think is an overly broad notion of what constitutes research into AI alignment, and much of the sum was driven by adding up time from lots of researchers spending a small fraction of their time on safety research; while our aim is to quantify the number of researchers focused on AI safety.</p>
<p>AI Watch attempted a headcount of AI Safety researchers, which found 160 notable researchers who have worked on AI Safety. This includes many people who have not published on AI safety in over a year, whereas for the estimate of 87,000 above, all had published in the last year. On the other hand, the bar for being a ‘notable’ researcher might be higher than publishing in arXiv.</p>
<p>Our final estimate is 300 researchers focused on AI safety.&#160;<a href="#fnref:17" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
